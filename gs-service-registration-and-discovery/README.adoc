This guide walks you through the process of standing up and consuming the Netflix Eureka service registry.om

== What you'll build

You'll setup a https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix[Netflix Eureka service registry] and then build a client that both registers itself with the registry and uses it to resolve its own host. A service registry is useful because it enables client-side load-balancing and decouples service providers from consumers without the need for DNS.

== Stand up a Eureka Service Registry
You'll first need a Eureka Service registry. You can use Spring Cloud's `@EnableEurekaServer` to standup a registry that other applications can talk to. This is a regular Spring Boot application with one annotation added to _enable_ the service registry.

`eureka-service/src/main/java/hello/EurekaServiceApplication.java`
[source,java]
----

When the registry starts up it will complain, with a stacktrace, that there are no replica nodes for the registry to connect to. In a production environment, you will want more than one instance of the registry. For our simple purposes, however, it sufficies to disable the relevant logging.

By default, the registry will _also_ attempt to register itself, so you'll need to disable that, as well.

It's a good convention to put this registry on a separate port when using it locally.

Add some properties to your `eureka-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` to handle all of these requirements.

== Talking to the Registry

Now that we've stood up a service registry, let's stand up a client that both registers itself with the registry and uses the Spring Cloud `DiscoveryClient` abstraction to interrogate the registry for it's own host and port. The `@EnableDiscoveryClient` activates the Netflix Eureka `DiscoveryClient` implementation. There are other implementations for other service registries like https://www.consul.io/[Hashicorp's Consul] or https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Apache Zookeeper].

Whatever implementation you choose, you'll soon see the `eureka-client` registered under whatever name you specify in the `spring.application.name` property. This property is used a lot in Spring Cloud, often in the earliest phases of a service's configuration. This property is used in service bootstrap and so by convention lives in `eureka-client/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties`  where it's found _before_ `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

`eureka-client/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties`

The `eureka-client` defines a Spring MVC REST endpoint, `ServiceInstanceRestController`, that returns an enumeration of all the `ServiceInstance` instances registered in the registry at  `http://localhost:8080/service-instances/a-bootiful-client`. Consult the https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/[Building a RESTful Web Service]  guide to learn more about building REST services with Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

== Test the application

Test the end-to-end result by starting the `eureka-service` first and then, once loaded, starting the `eureka-client`. The `eureka-client` will take about a minute to register itself in the registry and to refresh its own list of registered instances from the registry. All of these thresholds are configurable. Visit the `eureka-client` in the browser, `http://localhost:8080/service-instances/a-bootiful-client`. There, you should see the `ServiceInstance` for the `eureka-client` reflected in the response.


== Summary
Congratulations! You've just used Spring to stand up a Netflix Eureka service registry and to use that registry in a client application.
