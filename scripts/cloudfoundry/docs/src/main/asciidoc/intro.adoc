Spring Cloud for Cloudfoundry makes it easy to run
https://github.com/spring-cloud[Spring Cloud] apps in
https://github.com/cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry] (the Platform as a
Service). Cloud Foundry has the notion of a "service", which is
middlware that you "bind" to an app, essentially providing it with an
environment variable containing credentials (e.g. the location and
username to use for the service).

The `spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-commons` module configures the
Reactor-based Cloud Foundry Java client, v 3.0, and can be used standalone.

The `spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-web` project provides basic support for
some enhanced features of webapps in Cloud Foundry: binding
automatically to single-sign-on services and optionally enabling
sticky routing for discovery.

The `spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-discovery` project provides an
implementation of Spring Cloud Commons `DiscoveryClient` so you can
`@EnableDiscoveryClient` and provide your credentials as
`spring.cloud.cloudfoundry.discovery.[username,password]` (also `*.url` if you are not connecting to https://run.pivotal.io[Pivotal Web Services]) and then you
can use the `DiscoveryClient` directly or via a `LoadBalancerClient`.
