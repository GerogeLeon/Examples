== Introduction

Spring Cloud Sleuth implements a distributed tracing solution for http://cloud.spring.io[Spring Cloud].

=== Terminology

Spring Cloud Sleuth borrows http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html[Dapper's] terminology.

*Span*: The basic unit of work. For example, sending an RPC is a new span, as is sending a response to an RPC.
Spans are identified by a unique 64-bit ID for the span and another 64-bit ID for the trace the span is a part of.
Spans also have other data, such as descriptions, timestamped events, key-value annotations (tags), the ID of the span that caused them, and process IDs (normally IP addresses).

Spans can be started and stopped, and they keep track of their timing information.
Once you create a span, you must stop it at some point in the future.

TIP: The initial span that starts a trace is called a `root span`. The value of the ID
of that span is equal to the trace ID.

*Trace:* A set of spans forming a tree-like structure.
For example, if you run a distributed big-data store, a trace might be formed by a `PUT` request.

*Annotation:*  Used to record the existence of an event in time. With
https://github.com/openzipkin/brave[Brave] instrumentation, we no longer need to set special events
for https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin] to understand who the client and server are, where
the request started, and where it ended. For learning purposes,
however, we mark these events to highlight what kind
of an action took place.

* *cs*: Client Sent. The client has made a request. This annotation indicates the start of the span.
* *sr*: Server Received: The server side got the request and started processing it.
Subtracting the `cs` timestamp from this timestamp reveals the network latency.
* *ss*: Server Sent. Annotated upon completion of request processing (when the response got sent back to the client).
Subtracting the `sr` timestamp from this timestamp reveals the time needed by the server side to process the request.
* *cr*> Client Received. Signifies the end of the span.
The client has successfully received the response from the server side.
Subtracting the `cs` timestamp from this timestamp reveals the whole time needed by the client to receive the response from the server.

The following image shows how *Span* and *Trace* look in a system, together with the Zipkin annotations:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/trace-id.png[Trace Info propagation]

Each color of a note signifies a span (there are seven spans - from *A* to *G*).
Consider the following note:

[source]
Trace Id = X
Span Id = D
Client Sent

This note indicats thatthe current span has *Trace Id* set to *X* and *Span Id* set to *D*.
Also, the `Client Sent` event took place.

The following image shows how parent-child relationships of spans look:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/parents.png[Parent child relationship]

=== Purpose

The following sections refer to the example shown in the preceding image.

==== Distributed Tracing with Zipkin

This example has seven spans.
If you go to traces in Zipkin, you can see this number in the second trace, as shown in the following image:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-traces.png[Traces]

However, if you pick a particular trace, you can see four spans, as shown in the following image:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-ui.png[Traces Info propagation]

NOTE: When you pick a particular trace, you see merged spans.
That means that, if there were two spans sent to Zipkin with Server Received and Server Sent or Client Received and Client Sent annotations, they are presented as a single span.

Why is there a difference between the seven and four spans in this case?

* Two spans come from the `http:/start` span. It has the Server Received (`sr`) and Server Sent (`ss`) annotations.
* Two spans come from the RPC call from `service1` to `service2` to the `http:/foo` endpoint.
The Client Sent (`cs`) and Client Received (`cr`) events took place on the `service1` side.
Server Received (`sr`) and Server Sent (`ss`) events took place on the `service2` side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.
* Two spans come from the RPC call from `service2` to `service3` to the `http:/bar` endpoint.
The Client Sent (`cs`) and Client Received (`cr`) events took place on the `service2` side.
The Server Received (`sr`) and Server Sent (`ss`) events took place on the `service3` side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.
* Two spans come from the RPC call from `service2` to `service4` to the `http:/baz` endpoint.
The Client Sent (`cs`) and Client Received (`cr`) events took place on the `service2` side.
Server Received (`sr`) and Server Sent (`ss`) events took place on the `service4` side.
These two spans form one logical span related to an RPC call.

So, if we count the physical spans, we have one from `http:/start`, two from `service1` calling `service2`, two from `service2`
calling `service3`, and two from `service2` calling `service4`. In sum, we have a total of seven spans.

Logically, we see the information of four total Spans because we have one span related to the incoming request
to `service1` and three spans related to RPC calls.

==== Visualizing errors

Zipkin lets you visualize errors in your trace.
When an exception was thrown and was not caught, we set proper tags on the span, which Zipkin can then properly colorize.
You could see in the list of traces one trace that is red. That appears because an exception was thrown.

If you click that trace, you see a similar picture, as follows:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-error-traces.png[Error Traces]

If you then click on one of the spans, you see the following

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/zipkin-error-trace-screenshot.png[Error Traces Info propagation]

The span shows the reason for the error and the whole stack trace related to it.

==== Distributed Tracing with Brave

Starting with version `2.0.0`, Spring Cloud Sleuth uses https://github.com/openzipkin/brave[Brave] as the tracing library.
Consequently, Sleuth no longer takes care of storing the context but delegates that work to Brave.

Due to the fact that Sleuth had different naming and tagging conventions than Brave, we decided to follow Brave's conventions from now on.
However, if you want to use the legacy Sleuth approaches, you can set the `spring.sleuth.http.legacy.enabled` property to `true`.

==== Log correlation

When using grep to read the logs of those four applications by scanning for a trace ID equal to (for example) `2485ec27856c56f4`, you get output resembling the following:

[source]
service1.log:2016-02-26 11:15:47.561  INFO [service1,2485ec27856c56f4,2485ec27856c56f4,true] 68058 --- [nio-8081-exec-1] i.s.c.sleuth.docs.service1.Application   : Hello from service1. Calling service2

If you use a log aggregating tool (such as https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana], http://www.splunk.com/[Splunk], and others), you can order the events that took place.
An example from Kibana would resemble the following image:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/kibana.png[Log correlation with Kibana]

If you want to use https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash], the following listing shows the Grok pattern for Logstash:

[source]
filter {
       # pattern matching logback pattern
       grok {
              match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\s+%{LOGLEVEL:severity}\s+\[%{DATA:service},%{DATA:trace},%{DATA:span},%{DATA:exportable}\]\s+%{DATA:pid}\s+---\s+\[%{DATA:thread}\]\s+%{DATA:class}\s+:\s+%{GREEDYDATA:rest}" }
       }
}

NOTE: If you want to use Grok together with the logs from Cloud Foundry, you have to use the following pattern:
[source]
filter {
       # pattern matching logback pattern
       grok {
              match => { "message" => "(?m)OUT\s+%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\s+%{LOGLEVEL:severity}\s+\[%{DATA:service},%{DATA:trace},%{DATA:span},%{DATA:exportable}\]\s+%{DATA:pid}\s+---\s+\[%{DATA:thread}\]\s+%{DATA:class}\s+:\s+%{GREEDYDATA:rest}" }
       }
}

===== JSON Logback with Logstash

Often, you do not want to store your logs in a text file but in a JSON file that Logstash can immediately pick.
To do so, you have to do the following (for readability, we pass the dependencies in the `groupId:artifactId:version` notation).

*Dependencies Setup*

. Ensure that Logback is on the classpath (`ch.qos.logback:logback-core`).
. Add Logstash Logback encode. For example, to use version `4.6`, add `net.logstash.logback:logstash-logback-encoder:4.6`.

*Logback Setup*

Consider the following example of a Logback configuration file (named https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/sleuth-documentation-apps/blob/master/service1/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[logback-spring.xml]).

[source,xml]
-----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud-samples/sleuth-documentation-apps/master/service1/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[]
-----

That Logback configuration file:

* Logs information from the application in a JSON format to a `build/${spring.application.name}.json` file.
* Has commented out two additional appenders: console and standard log file.
* Has the same logging pattern as the one presented in the previous section.

NOTE: If you use a custom `logback-spring.xml`, you must pass the `spring.application.name` in the  `bootstrap` rather than the `application` property file.
Otherwise, your custom logback file does not properly read the property.

==== Propagating Span Context

The span context is the state that must get propagated to any child spans across process boundaries.
Part of the Span Context is the Baggage. The trace and span IDs are a required part of the span context.
Baggage is an optional part.

Baggage is a set of key:value pairs stored in the span context.
Baggage travels together with the trace and is attached to every span.
Spring Cloud Sleuth understands that a header is baggage-related if the HTTP header is prefixed with `baggage-` and, for messaging, it starts with `baggage_`.

IMPORTANT: There is currently no limitation of the count or size of baggage items.
However, keep in mind that too many can decrease system throughput or increase RPC latency.
In extreme cases, too much baggage can crash the application, due to exceeding transport-level message or header capacity.

The following example shows setting baggage on a span:

[source,java]
----
include::{github-raw}/spring-cloud-sleuth-core/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument/web/multiple/MultipleHopsIntegrationTests.java[tags=baggage,indent=0]
}
----

===== Baggage versus Span Tags

Baggage travels with the trace (every child span contains the baggage of its parent).
Zipkin has no knowledge of baggage and does not receive that information.

Tags are attached to a specific span. In other words, they are presented only for that particular span.
However, you can search by tag to find the trace, assuming a span having the searched tag value exists.

If you want to be able to lookup a span based on baggage, you should add a corresponding entry as a tag in the root span.

IMPORTANT: The span must be in scope.

The following listing shows integration tests that use baggage:

[source,java]
----
include::{github-raw}/spring-cloud-sleuth-core/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/instrument/web/multiple/MultipleHopsIntegrationTests.java[tags=baggage_tag,indent=0]

=== Adding Sleuth to the Project

This section addresses how to add Sleuth to your project with either Maven or Gradle.

IMPORTANT: To ensure that your application name is properly displayed in Zipkin, set the `spring.application.name` property in `bootstrap.yml`.

==== Only Sleuth (log correlation)

If you want to use only Spring Cloud Sleuth without the Zipkin integration, add the `spring-cloud-starter-sleuth` module to your project.

The following example shows how to add Sleuth with Maven:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
    <dependencyManagement> <1>
          <dependencies>
              <dependency>

                  <version>${release.train.version}</version>
                  <type>pom</type>
                  <scope>import</scope>
              </dependency>
          </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>

    <dependency> <2>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----
<1> We recommend that you add the dependency management through the Spring BOM so that you need not manage versions yourself.
<2> Add the dependency to `spring-cloud-starter-sleuth`.

The following example shows how to add Sleuth with Gradle:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
dependencyManagement { <1>
    imports {
        mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-dependencies:${releaseTrainVersion}"
    }
}

dependencies { <2>
    compile "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-sleuth"
}
----
<1> We recommend that you add the dependency management through the Spring BOM so that you need not manage versions yourself.
<2> Add the dependency to `spring-cloud-starter-sleuth`.

==== Sleuth with Zipkin via HTTP

If you want both Sleuth and Zipkin, add the `spring-cloud-starter-zipkin` dependency.

The following example shows how to do so for Maven:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
    <dependencyManagement> <1>
          <dependencies>

                  <scope>import</scope>
              </dependency>
          </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>

        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----
<1> We recommend that you add the dependency management through the Spring BOM so that you need not manage versions yourself.
<2> Add the dependency to `spring-cloud-starter-zipkin`.

The following example shows how to do so for Gradle:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
dependencyManagement { <1>
    imports {
        mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-dependencies:${releaseTrainVersion}"
    }
}

dependencies { <2>
    compile "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zipkin"
}
----
<1> We recommend that you add the dependency management through the Spring BOM so that you need not manage versions yourself.
<2> Add the dependency to `spring-cloud-starter-zipkin`.

==== Sleuth with Zipkin over RabbitMQ or Kafka

If you want to use RabbitMQ or Kafka instead of HTTP, add the `spring-rabbit` or `spring-kafka` dependency.
The default destination name is `zipkin`.

CAUTION: `spring-cloud-sleuth-stream` is deprecated and incompatible with these destinations.

If you want Sleuth over RabbitMQ, add the `spring-cloud-starter-zipkin` and `spring-rabbit`
dependencies.

The following example shows how to do so for Gradle:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
    <dependencyManagement> <1>
          <dependencies>
              <dependency>
