== Spring Cloud Sleuth Samples

=== Running the samples

There are a few samples with slightly different features. You can run all of them from an IDE via the main method, or on the command line with `mvn spring-boot:run`. They all log trace and span data on the console by default. Here's a list:

* `spring-cloud-sleuth-sample`: vanilla (no zipkin) web app that calls back to itself on various endpoints ("/", "/call", "/async")

* `spring-cloud-sleuth-sample-zipkin`: same as vanilla sample but with zipkin (set `sample.zipkin.enabled=true` if you have a collector running)

* `spring-cloud-sleuth-sample-messaging`: a Spring Integration application with two HTTP endpoints ("/" and "/xform")

* `spring-cloud-sleuth-sample-ribbon`: two endpoints ("/" and "/call") that make calls to the "zipkin" sample via Ribbon. Also has `@EnableZUulProxy" so if the other samples are running they are proxied at "/messaging", "/zipkin", "/vanilla" (see "/routes" for a list).

The Ribbon sample makes an interesting demo or playground for learning about zipkin. In the screenshot below you can see a trace with 3 spans - it starts in the "testSleuthRibbon" app and crosses to "testSleuthMessaging" for the next 2 spans.

=== Running samples with Zipkin

1. Optionally run the https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin[Zipkin] Server, e.g. via docker compose (there's a `docker-compose.yml` in https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth-samples/spring-cloud-sleuth-sample-zipkin[Spring Cloud Sleuth], or in https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin[Docker Zipkin]
7. Run the zipkin sample application (set `sample.zipkin.enabled=false` if you have no Zipkin running). If you are using a VM to run docker you might need to tunnel port 9411 to localhost, or change the `spring.zipkin.baseUrl`.
8. Hit `http://localhost:3380`, `http://localhost:3380/call`, `http://localhost:3380/async` for some interesting sample traces (the app callas back to itself).
9. Go to `http://localhost:9411` for Zipkin's UI (if you are using boot2docker the host will be different)

NOTE: You can see the zipkin spans without the UI (in logs) if you run the sample with `sample.zipkin.enabled=false`.

> The fact that the first trace in says "testSleuthMessaging" seems to be a bug in the UI (it has some annotations from that service, but it originates in the "testSleuthRibbon" service).
