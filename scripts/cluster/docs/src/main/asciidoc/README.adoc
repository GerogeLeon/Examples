This project is now superseded by code in Spring Integration. All the interfaces
here have counterparts in the main Spring libraries, and the implementations are
mostly parallel too (etcd is an exception because of the lack of support for
v3 in third party libraries). The 1.0.1 release deprecates everything in favour 
of Spring Integration.

N.B. For Hazelcast the support is in
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-extensions/tree/master/spring-integration-hazelcast[an
extension project].
