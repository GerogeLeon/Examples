[[vault.config.authentication]]
== Authentication methods

Different organizations have different requirements for security
and authentication. Vault reflects that need by shipping multiple authentication
methods. Spring Cloud Vault supports token and AppId authentication.

[[vault.config.authentication.token]]
=== Token authentication

Tokens are the core method for authentication within Vault.
Token authentication requires a static token to be provided using the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-commons.adoc#the-bootstrap-application-context[Bootstrap Application Context].

NOTE: Token authentication is the default authentication method.
If a token is disclosed an unintended party gains access to Vault and
can access secrets for the intended client.

.bootstrap.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: TOKEN
    token: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
----
====

* `authentication` setting this value to `TOKEN` selects the Token
authentication method
* `token` sets the static token to use

[[vault.config.authentication.appid]]
=== AppId authentication

Vault supports https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html[AppId]
authentication that consists of two hard to guess tokens. The AppId
defaults to `spring.application.name` that is statically configured.
The second token is the UserId which is a part determined by the application,
usually related to the runtime environment. IP address, Mac address or a
Docker container name are good examples. Spring Cloud Vault Config supports
IP address, Mac address and static UserId's (e.g. supplied via System properties).
The IP and Mac address are represented as Hex-encoded SHA256 hash.

IP address-based UserId's use the local host's IP address.

.bootstrap.yml using SHA256 IP-Address UserId's
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPID
    app-id:
        user-id: IP_ADDRESS
----
====

* `authentication` setting this value to `APPID` selects the AppId
authentication method
* `app-id-path` sets the path of the AppId mount to use
* `user-id` sets the UserId method. Possible values are `IP_ADDRESS`,
`MAC_ADDRESS` or a class name implementing a custom `AppIdUserIdMechanism`

The corresponding command to generate the IP address UserId from a command line is:

----
$ echo -n 192.168.99.1 | sha256sum
----

NOTE: Including the line break of `echo` leads to a different hash value
so make sure to include the `-n` flag.

Mac address-based UserId's obtain their network device from the
localhost-bound device. The configuration also allows specifying
a `network-interface` hint to pick the right device. The value of
`network-interface` is optional and can be either an interface
name or interface index (0-based).

.bootstrap.yml using SHA256 Mac-Address UserId's
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPID
    app-id:
        user-id: MAC_ADDRESS
        network-interface: eth0
----
====

* `network-interface` sets network interface to obtain the physical address


The corresponding command to generate the IP address UserId from a command line is:

----
$ echo -n 0AFEDE1234AC | sha256sum
----

NOTE: The Mac address is specified uppercase and without colons.
Including the line break of `echo` leads to a different hash value
so make sure to include the `-n` flag.

==== Custom UserId

The UserId generation is an open mechanism. You can set
`spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id` to any string and the configured
value will be used as static UserId.

A more advanced approach lets you set `spring.cloud.vault.app-id.user-id` to a
classname. This class must be on your classpath and must implement
the `org.springframework.cloud.vault.AppIdUserIdMechanism` interface
and the `createUserId` method. Spring Cloud Vault will obtain the UserId
by calling `createUserId` each time it authenticates using AppId to
obtain a token.

.bootstrap.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPID
    app-id:
        user-id: com.examlple.MyUserIdMechanism

====
[source,yaml]

public class MyUserIdMechanism implements AppIdUserIdMechanism {

  @Override
  public String createUserId() {
    String userId = ...
    return userId;
  }
}
----

=== AppRole authentication

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/app-id.html[AppRole] is intended for machine
authentication, like the deprecated (since Vault 0.6.1) <<vault.config.authentication.appid>>.
AppRole authentication consists of two hard to guess (secret) tokens: RoleId and SecretId.

Spring Vault supports various AppRole scenarios (push/pull mode and wrapped).

RoleId and optionally SecretId must be provided by configuration,
Spring Vault will not look up these or create a custom SecretId.

.bootstrap.yml with AppRole authentication properties
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: APPROLE
    app-role:
        role-id: bde2076b-cccb-3cf0-d57e-bca7b1e83a52
----
====

The following scenarios are supported along the required configuration details:

[[vault.config.authentication.awsec2]]
=== AWS-EC2 authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html[aws-ec2]
auth backend provides a secure introduction mechanism
for AWS EC2 instances, allowing automated retrieval of a Vault
token. Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
cryptographically signed dynamic metadata information that uniquely
represents each EC2 instance.

.bootstrap.yml using AWS-EC2 Authentication
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_EC2
----
====

AWS-EC2 authentication enables nonce by default to follow
the Trust On First Use (TOFU) principle. Any unintended party that
gains access to the PKCS#7 identity metadata can authenticate
against Vault.

During the first login, Spring Cloud Vault generates a nonce
that is stored in the auth backend aside the instance Id.
Re-authentication requires the same nonce to be sent. Any other
party does not have the nonce and can raise an alert in Vault for
further investigation.

The nonce is kept in memory and is lost during application restart.
You can configure a static nonce with `spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.nonce`.

AWS-EC2 authentication roles are optional and default to the AMI.
You can configure the authentication role by setting the
`spring.cloud.vault.aws-ec2.role` property.

.bootstrap.yml with configured role
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: AWS_EC2
    aws-ec2:

        aws-ec2-path: aws-ec2
        identity-document: http://...
        nonce: my-static-nonce
----
====

* `authentication` setting this value to `AWS_EC2` selects the AWS EC2
authentication method
* `role` sets the name of the role against which the login is being attempted.
* `aws-ec2-path` sets the path of the AWS EC2 mount to use
* `identity-document` sets URL of the PKCS#7 AWS EC2 identity document
* `nonce` used for AWS-EC2 authentication. An empty nonce defaults to nonce generation

[[vault.config.authentication.awsiam]]
=== AWS-IAM authentication

The https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws-ec2.html[aws] backend provides a secure
authentication mechanism for AWS IAM roles, allowing the automatic authentication with
vault based on the current IAM role of the running application.
 Unlike most Vault authentication backends, this backend
does not require first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive
credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc.).
Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party and uses the
4 pieces of information signed by the caller with their IAM credentials
 to verify that the caller is indeed using that IAM role.

The current IAM role the application is running in is automatically calculated.
If you are running your application on AWS ECS then the application
will use the IAM role assigned to the ECS task of the running container.
If you are running your application naked on top of an EC2 instance then
the IAM role used will be the one assigned to the EC2 instance.

When using the AWS-IAM authentication you must create a role in Vault
and assign it to your IAM role. An empty `role` defaults to
the friendly name the current IAM role.

    aws-iam:
        role: my-dev-role
        aws-path: aws
        server-id: some.server.name
----
====

* `role` sets the name of the role against which the login is being attempted. This should be bound to your IAM role. If one is not supplied then the friendly name of the current IAM user will be used as the vault role.
* `aws-path` sets the path of the AWS mount to use
* `server-id` sets the value to use for the `X-Vault-AWS-IAM-Server-ID` header preventing certain types of replay attacks.

AWS-IAM requires the AWS Java SDK dependency (`com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core`)
as the authentication implementation uses AWS SDK types for credentials and request signing.

[[vault.config.authentication.clientcert]]
=== TLS certificate authentication

The `cert` auth backend allows authentication using SSL/TLS client
certificates that are either signed by a CA or self-signed.

To enable `cert` authentication you need to:

1. Use SSL, see <<vault.config.ssl>>
2. Configure a Java `Keystore` that contains the client
certificate and the private key
3. Set the `spring.cloud.vault.authentication` to `CERT`

.bootstrap.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    authentication: CERT
    ssl:
        key-store: classpath:keystore.jks
        key-store-password: changeit
        cert-auth-path: cert
----
====

See also: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/cert.html[Vault Documentation: Using the Cert auth backend]

[[vault.config.authentication.cubbyhole]]
=== Cubbyhole authentication

Cubbyhole authentication uses Vault primitives to provide a secured authentication
workflow. Cubbyhole authentication uses tokens as primary login method.
An ephemeral token is used to obtain a second, login VaultToken from Vault's
Cubbyhole secret backend. The login token is usually longer-lived and used to
interact with Vault. The login token will be retrieved from a wrapped
response stored at `/cubbyhole/response`.

*Creating a wrapped token*

NOTE: Response Wrapping for token creation requires Vault 0.6.0 or higher.

[[vault.config.authentication.kubernetes]]
=== Kubernetes authentication

Kubernetes authentication mechanism (since Vault 0.8.3) allows to authenticate with Vault using a Kubernetes Service Account Token.
The authentication is role based and the role is bound to a service account name and a namespace.

A file containing a JWT token for a pod’s service account is automatically mounted at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.

.bootstrap.yml with all Kubernetes authentication properties

[[vault.config.backends]]
== Secret Backends

[[vault.config.backends.kv]]
[[vault.config.backends.generic]]
=== Generic Backend

Spring Cloud Vault supports at the basic level the generic secret
backend. The generic secret backend allows storage of arbitrary
values as key-value store. A single context can store one or many
key-value tuples. Contexts can be organized hierarchically.
Spring Cloud Vault allows using the Application name
and a default context name (`application`) in combination with active
profiles.
----
/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{default-context}/{profile}
/secret/{default-context}
----
The application name is determined by the properties:

* `spring.cloud.vault.generic.application-name`
* `spring.cloud.vault.application-name`
* `spring.application.name`

Secrets can be obtained from other contexts within the generic backend by adding their
paths to the application name, separated by commas. For example, given the application
name `usefulapp,mysql1,projectx/aws`, each of these folders will be used:

* `/secret/usefulapp`
* `/secret/mysql1`
* `/secret/projectx/aws`

Spring Cloud Vault adds all active profiles to the list of possible context paths.
No active profiles will skip accessing contexts with a profile name.

Properties are exposed like they are stored (i.e. without additional prefixes).

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    generic:
        enabled: true
        backend: secret
        profile-separator: '/'
        default-context: application
        application-name: my-app
----
====

* `enabled` setting this value to `false` disables the secret backend
config usage
* `backend` sets the path of the secret mount to use
* `default-context` sets the context name used by all applications
* `application-name` overrides the application name for use in the generic backend
* `profile-separator` separates the profile name from the context in
property sources with profiles

NOTE: The key-value secret backend can be operated in versioned (v2) and non-versioned (v1) modes. Depending on the mode of operation, a different API is required to access secrets. Make sure to enable `generic` secret backend usage for non-versioned key-value backends and `kv` secret backend usage for versioned key-value backends.

See also: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1.html[Vault Documentation: Using the KV Secrets Engine - Version 1 (generic secret backend)]

[[vault.config.backends.kv.versioned]]
=== Versioned Key-Value Backend

Spring Cloud Vault supports the versioned Key-Value secret
backend. The key-value backend allows storage of arbitrary
values as key-value store. A single context can store one or many
key-value tuples. Contexts can be organized hierarchically.
Spring Cloud Vault allows using the Application name
and a default context name (`application`) in combination with active
profiles.
----
/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{default-context}/{profile}
/secret/{default-context}
----
The application name is determined by the properties:

* `spring.cloud.vault.kv.application-name`
* `spring.cloud.vault.application-name`
* `spring.application.name`

Secrets can be obtained from other contexts within the key-value backend by adding their
paths to the application name, separated by commas. For example, given the application
name `usefulapp,mysql1,projectx/aws`, each of these folders will be used:

* `/secret/usefulapp`
* `/secret/mysql1`
* `/secret/projectx/aws`

Spring Cloud Vault adds all active profiles to the list of possible context paths.
No active profiles will skip accessing contexts with a profile name.

Properties are exposed like they are stored (i.e. without additional prefixes).

NOTE: Spring Cloud Vault adds the `data/` context between the mount path and the actual context path.

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    kv:
        enabled: true
        backend: secret
        profile-separator: '/'
        default-context: application
        application-name: my-app
----
====

* `enabled` setting this value to `false` disables the secret backend
config usage
* `backend` sets the path of the secret mount to use
* `default-context` sets the context name used by all applications
* `application-name` overrides the application name for use in the generic backend
* `profile-separator` separates the profile name from the context in
property sources with profiles

NOTE: The key-value secret backend can be operated in versioned (v2) and non-versioned (v1) modes. Depending on the mode of operation, a different API is required to access secrets. Make sure to enable `generic` secret backend usage for non-versioned key-value backends and `kv` secret backend usage for versioned key-value backends.

Vault supports several database secret backends to generate database
credentials dynamically based on configured roles. This means
services that need to access a database no longer need to configure
credentials: they can request them from Vault, and use Vault's leasing
mechanism to more easily roll keys.

Spring Cloud Vault integrates with these backends:

* <<vault.config.backends.database>>
* <<vault.config.backends.cassandra>>
* <<vault.config.backends.mongodb>>
* <<vault.config.backends.mysql>>
* <<vault.config.backends.postgresql>>

Using a database secret backend requires to enable the
backend in the configuration and the `spring-cloud-vault-config-databases`
dependency.

Vault ships since 0.7.1 with a dedicated `database` secret backend that allows
database integration via plugins. You can use that specific backend by using the
generic database backend. Make sure to specify the appropriate
backend path, e.g. `spring.cloud.vault.mysql.role.backend=database`.

NOTE: Enabling multiple JDBC-compliant databases will generate credentials
and store them by default in the same property keys hence property names for
JDBC secrets need to be configured separately.

[[vault.config.backends.database]]
=== Database

Spring Cloud Vault can obtain credentials for any database listed at
https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/databases/index.html.
The integration can be enabled by setting
`spring.cloud.vault.database.enabled=true` (default `false`) and
providing the role name with `spring.cloud.vault.database.role=…`.

While the database backend is a generic one, `spring.cloud.vault.database`
specifically targets JDBC databases. Username and password are
stored in `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password`
so using Spring Boot will pick up the generated credentials
for your `DataSource` without further configuration.
You can configure the property names by setting
`spring.cloud.vault.database.username-property` and
`spring.cloud.vault.database.password-property`.

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    database:
        enabled: true
        role: readonly
        backend: database
        username-property: spring.datasource.username
        password-property: spring.datasource.username
----
====

* `enabled` setting this value to `true` enables the Database backend config usage
* `role` sets the role name of the Database role definition
* `backend` sets the path of the Database mount to use
* `username-property` sets the property name in which the Database username is stored
* `password-property` sets the property name in which the Database password is stored

[[vault.config.backends.configurer]]
== Configure `PropertySourceLocator` behavior

Spring Cloud Vault uses property-based configuration to create ``PropertySource``s
for generic and discovered secret backends.

Discovered backends provide `VaultSecretBackendDescriptor` beans to describe the configuration
state to use secret backend as `PropertySource`. A `SecretBackendMetadataFactory` is required
to create a `SecretBackendMetadata` object which contains path, name and property transformation
configuration.

`SecretBackendMetadata` is used to back a particular `PropertySource`.

You can register an arbitrary number of beans implementing `VaultConfigurer` for customization.
Default generic and discovered backend registration is disabled if Spring Cloud Vault discovers
at least one `VaultConfigurer` bean. You can however enable default registration with
`SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends()` and `SecretBackendConfigurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends()`.

====
[source,java]
----
public class CustomizationBean implements VaultConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addSecretBackends(SecretBackendConfigurer configurer) {

        configurer.add("secret/my-application");

        configurer.registerDefaultGenericSecretBackends(false);
        configurer.registerDefaultDiscoveredSecretBackends(true);
    }
}
----
====

NOTE: All customization is required to happen in the bootstrap context. Add your configuration
classes to `META-INF/spring.factories` at `org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapConfiguration`
in your application.

== Service Registry Configuration

You can use a `DiscoveryClient` (such as from Spring Cloud Consul) to locate
a Vault server by setting spring.cloud.vault.discovery.enabled=true (default `false`).
The net result of that is that your apps need a bootstrap.yml (or an environment variable)
with the appropriate discovery configuration.
The benefit is that the Vault can change its co-ordinates, as long as the discovery service
is a fixed point. The default service id is `vault` but you can change that on the client with
`spring.cloud.vault.discovery.serviceId`.

The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata map
(e.g. for Eureka we have eureka.instance.metadataMap). Some additional properties of the service
may need to be configured in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect
correctly. Service registries that do not provide details about transport layer security
need to provide a `scheme` metadata entry to be set either to `https` or `http`.
If no scheme is configured and the service is not exposed as secure service, then
configuration defaults to `spring.cloud.vault.scheme` which is `https` when it's not set.

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault.discovery:
    enabled: true
    service-id: my-vault-service
----
====

[[vault.config.fail-fast]]
== Vault Client Fail Fast

In some cases, it may be desirable to fail startup of a service if
it cannot connect to the Vault Server.  If this is the desired
behavior, set the bootstrap configuration property
`spring.cloud.vault.fail-fast=true` and the client will halt with
an Exception.

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    fail-fast: true
----
====

[[vault.config.ssl]]
== Vault Client SSL configuration

SSL can be configured declaratively by setting various properties.
You can set either `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` to configure
JVM-wide SSL settings or `spring.cloud.vault.ssl.trust-store`
to set SSL settings only for Spring Cloud Vault Config.

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    ssl:
        trust-store: classpath:keystore.jks
        trust-store-password: changeit
----
====

* `trust-store` sets the resource for the trust-store. SSL-secured Vault
communication will validate the Vault SSL certificate with the specified
trust-store.
* `trust-store-password` sets the trust-store password


Please note that configuring `spring.cloud.vault.ssl.*` can be only
applied when either Apache Http Components or the OkHttp client
is on your class-path.

[[vault-lease-renewal]]
== Lease lifecycle management (renewal and revocation)

With every secret, Vault creates a lease:
metadata containing information such as a time duration,
renewability, and more.

Vault promises that the data will be valid for the given duration,
or Time To Live (TTL). Once the lease is expired, Vault can
revoke the data, and the consumer of the secret can no longer
be certain that it is valid.

Spring Cloud Vault maintains a lease lifecycle beyond
the creation of login tokens and secrets. That said,
login tokens and secrets associated with a lease
are scheduled for renewal just before the lease expires
until terminal expiry.
Application shutdown revokes obtained login tokens and renewable
leases.

Secret service and database backends (such as MongoDB or MySQL)
usually generate a renewable lease so generated credentials will
be disabled on application shutdown.

NOTE: Static tokens are not renewed or revoked.

Lease renewal and revocation is enabled by default and can
be disabled by setting `spring.cloud.vault.config.lifecycle.enabled`
to `false`. This is not recommended as leases can expire and
Spring Cloud Vault cannot longer access Vault or services
using generated credentials and valid credentials remain active
after application shutdown.

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    config.lifecycle.enabled: true
----
