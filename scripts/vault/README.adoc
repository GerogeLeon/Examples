Spring Cloud Vault Config provides client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With https://www.vaultproject.io[HashiCorp's Vault] you have a central place to manage external secret properties for applications across all environments. Vault can manage static and dynamic secrets such as username/password for remote applications/resources and provide credentials for external services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, Consul, AWS and more.

== Features

== Quick Start

:docs: http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/spring-cloud-vault.html

*Prerequisites*

To get started with Vault and this guide you need a
*NIX-like operating systems that provides:

* `wget`, `openssl` and `unzip`
* at least Java 7 and a properly configured `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

*Install Vault*

[source,bash]
----
$ src/test/bash/install_vault.sh
----

*Create SSL certificates for Vault*

[source,bash]
----
$ src/test/bash/create_certificates.sh
----

NOTE: `create_certificates.sh` creates certificates in `work/ca` and a JKS truststore `work/keystore.jks`. If you want to run Spring Cloud Vault using this quickstart guide you need to configure the truststore the `spring.cloud.vault.ssl.trust-store` property to `file:work/keystore.jks`.

[[quickstart.vault.start]]
*Start Vault server*

[source,bash]
----
$ src/test/bash/local_run_vault.sh
----

Vault is started listening on `0.0.0.0:8200` using the `inmem` storage and
`https`.
Vault is sealed and not initialized when starting up.

NOTE: If you want to run tests, leave Vault uninitialized. The tests will
initialize Vault and create a root token `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

If you want to use Vault for your application or give it a try then you need to initialize it first.

[source,bash]
----
$ export VAULT_ADDR="https://localhost:8200"
$ export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true # Don't do this for production
$ vault init
----

You should see something like:

[source,bash]
----
Key 1: 7149c6a2e16b8833f6eb1e76df03e47f6113a3288b3093faf5033d44f0e70fe701
Key 2: 901c534c7988c18c20435a85213c683bdcf0efcd82e38e2893779f152978c18c02
Key 3: 03ff3948575b1165a20c20ee7c3e6edf04f4cdbe0e82dbff5be49c63f98bc03a03
Key 4: 216ae5cc3ddaf93ceb8e1d15bb9fc3176653f5b738f5f3d1ee00cd7dccbe926e04
Key 5: b2898fc8130929d569c1677ee69dc5f3be57d7c4b494a6062693ce0b1c4d93d805
Initial Root Token: 19aefa97-cccc-bbbb-aaaa-225940e63d76

Vault initialized with 5 keys and a key threshold of 3. Please
securely distribute the above keys. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must provide at least 3 of these keys
to unseal it again.

Vault does not store the master key. Without at least 3 keys,
your Vault will remain permanently sealed.
----

Vault will initialize and return a set of unsealing keys and the root token.
Pick 3 keys and unseal Vault. Store the Vault token in the `VAULT_TOKEN`
 environment variable.

[source,bash]
----
$ vault unseal (Key 1)
$ vault unseal (Key 2)
$ vault unseal (Key 3)
$ export VAULT_TOKEN=(Root token)
# Required to run Spring Cloud Vault tests after manual initialization
$ vault token-create -id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -policy="root"
----

Spring Cloud Vault accesses different resources. By default, the secret
backend is enabled which accesses secret config settings via JSON endpoints.

The HTTP service has resources in the form:

----
/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{defaultContext}/{profile}
/secret/{defaultContext}
----

where the "application" is injected as the `spring.application.name` in the
`SpringApplication` (i.e. what is normally "application" in a regular
Spring Boot app), "profile" is an active profile (or comma-separated
list of properties). Properties retrieved from Vault will be used "as-is"
without further prefixing of the property names.

== Client Side Usage

To use these features in an application, just build it as a Spring
Boot application that depends on `spring-cloud-vault-config` (e.g. see
the test cases). Example Maven configuration:

.pom.xml
====
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.4.RELEASE</version>
    <relativePath /> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
</parent>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-vault-config</artifactId>
        <version>{spring-cloud-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

<!-- repositories also needed for snapshots and milestones -->
----
====

Then you can create a standard Spring Boot application, like this simple HTTP server:

====
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
----
====

When it runs it will pick up the external configuration from the
default local Vault server on port `8200` if it is running. To modify
the startup behavior you can change the location of the Vault server
using `bootstrap.properties` (like `application.properties` but for
the bootstrap phase of an application context), e.g.

.bootstrap.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    host: localhost
    port: 8200
    scheme: https
    uri: https://localhost:8200
    connection-timeout: 5000
    read-timeout: 15000
    config:
        order: -10
----
====

* `host` sets the hostname of the Vault host. The host name will be used
for SSL certificate validation
* `port` sets the Vault port
* `scheme` setting the scheme to `http` will use plain HTTP.
Supported schemes are `http` and `https`.
* `uri` configure the Vault endpoint with an URI. Takes precedence over host/port/scheme configuration
* `connection-timeout` sets the connection timeout in milliseconds
* `read-timeout` sets the read timeout in milliseconds
* `config.order` sets the order for the property source

Enabling further integrations requires additional dependencies and
configuration. Depending on how you have set up Vault you might need
additional configuration like
{docs}#vault.config.ssl[SSL] and
{docs}#vault.config.authentication[authentication].

If the application imports the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` project, the
status of the vault server will be available via the `/health` endpoint.

The vault health indicator can be enabled or disabled through the
property `health.vault.enabled` (default `true`).


=== Authentication

Vault requires an https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/auth.html[authentication mechanism] to https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html[authorize client requests].

Spring Cloud Vault supports multiple {docs}#vault.config.authentication[authentication mechanisms] to authenticate applications with Vault.

For a quickstart, use the root token printed by the <<quickstart.vault.start,Vault initialization>>.

.bootstrap.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.vault:
    token: 19aefa97-cccc-bbbb-aaaa-225940e63d76
----
====

WARNING: Consider carefully your security requirements. Static token authentication is fine if you want quickly get started with Vault, but a static token is not protected any further. Any disclosure to unintended parties allows Vault use with the associated token roles.

== Building

=== Build requirements for Vault

Spring Cloud Vault Config requires SSL certificates and a running
Vault instance listening on `localhost:8200`. Certificates and the Vault
setup are scripted, the scripts are located in `src/test/bash`.

The following scripts need to be run prior to building the project for the tests to pass.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./src/test/bash/install_vault.sh
$ ./src/test/bash/create_certificates.sh
$ ./src/test/bash/local_run_vault.sh
----

Leave Vault uninitialized, the tests will initialize and unseal Vault. They will also create a root token `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

Changes to the documentation should be made to the adocs found under `docs/src/main/asciidoc/`

`README.adoc` can be re-generated via the following

[source,bash]
----
$ ./docs/src/main/ruby/generate_readme.sh > README.adoc
----

This script requires ruby and the asciidoctor gem installed (`gem install asciidoctor`)

:jdkversion: 1.7

=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install JDK {jdkversion}.

Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ ./mvnw install
----

NOTE: You can also install Maven (>=3.3.3) yourself and run the `mvn` command
in place of `./mvnw` in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add `-P spring` if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.

NOTE: Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with
a value like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We try to cover this in
the `.mvn` configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.

For hints on how to build the project look in `.travis.yml` if there
is one. There should be a "script" and maybe "install" command. Also
look at the "services" section to see if any services need to be
running locally (e.g. mongo or rabbit).  Ignore the git-related bits
that you might find in "before_install" since they're related to setting git
credentials and you already have those.

The projects that require middleware generally include a
`docker-compose.yml`, so consider using
http://compose.docker.io/[Docker Compose] to run the middeware servers
in Docker containers. See the README in the
https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts[scripts demo
repository] for specific instructions about the common cases of mongo,
rabbit and redis.

NOTE: If all else fails, build with the command from `.travis.yml` (usually
`./mvnw install`).

=== Documentation

The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
http://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue as long as they use Maven 3.3.3 or better.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

NOTE: Older versions of m2e do not support Maven 3.3, so once the
projects are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell
m2eclipse to use the right profile for the projects.  If you
see many different errors related to the POMs in the projects, check
that you have an up to date installation.  If you can't upgrade m2e,
add the "spring" profile to your `settings.xml`. Alternatively you can
copy the repository settings from the "spring" profile of the parent
pom into your `settings.xml`.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.


== Contributing

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/code-of-conduct.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).
