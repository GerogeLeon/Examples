Spring Cloud Security offers a set of primitives for building secure
applications and services with minimum fuss. A declarative model which
can be heavily configured externally (or centrally) lends itself to
the implementation of large systems of co-operating, remote components,
usually with a central indentity management service. It is also extremely
easy to use in a service platform like Cloud Foundry. Building on
Spring Boot and Spring Security OAuth2 we can quickly create systems that
implement common patterns like single sign on, token relay and token
exchange.
