A task by itself can be useful, but integration of a task into a larger ecosystem lets it
be useful for more complex processing and orchestration. This section
covers the integration options for Spring Cloud Task with Spring Cloud Stream.

[[stream-integration-launching-sink]]
== Launching a Task from a Spring Cloud Stream

You can launch tasks from a stream. To do so, create a sink that listens for a message
that contains a `TaskLaunchRequest` as its payload. The `TaskLaunchRequest` contains:

* `uri`: To the task artifact that is to be executed.
* `applicationName`: The name that is associated with the task. If no
applicationName is set, the `TaskLaunchRequest` generates a task name
comprised of the following: `Task-<UUID>`.
* `commandLineArguments`: A list containing the command line arguments for the task.
* `environmentProperties`: A map containing the environment variables to be used by the
task.
* `deploymentProperties`: A map containing the properties that are used by the deployer to
deploy the task.

NOTE: If the payload is of a different type, the sink throws an exception.

For example, a stream can be created that has a processor that takes in data from an
HTTP source and creates a `GenericMessage` that contains the `TaskLaunchRequest` and sends
the message to its output channel. The task sink would then receive the message from its
input channnel and then launch the task.

To create a taskSink, you need only create a Spring Boot application that includes the
`EnableTaskLauncher` annotation, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTaskLauncher
public class TaskSinkApplication {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(TaskSinkApplication.class, args);
	}
}
----

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples[samples
module] of the Spring Cloud Task project contains a sample Sink and Processor. To install
these samples into your local maven repository, run a maven build from the
`spring-cloud-task-samples` directory with the `skipInstall` property set to `false`, as
shown in the following example:

`mvn clean install`

NOTE: The `maven.remoteRepositories.springRepo.url` property must be set to the location
of the remote repository in which the Ã¼ber-jar is located. If not set, there is no remote
repository, so it relies upon the local repository only.

[[stream-integration-launching-sink-dataflow]]
=== Spring Cloud Data Flow

To create a stream in Spring Cloud Data Flow, you must first register the Task Sink
Application we created. In the following example, we are registering the Processor and
Sink sample applications by using the Spring Cloud Data Flow shell:

[source,bash]
----
app register --name taskSink --type sink --uri maven://io.spring.cloud:tasksink:<version>
app register --name taskProcessor --type processor --uri maven:io.spring.cloud:taskprocessor:<version>
----

The following example shows how to create a stream from the Spring Cloud Data Flow shell:

[source,bash]
stream create foo --definition "http --server.port=9000|taskProcessor|taskSink" --deploy

[[stream-integration-events]]
== Spring Cloud Task Events

Spring Cloud Task provides the ability to emit events through a Spring Cloud Stream
channel when the task is run through a Spring Cloud Stream channel. A task listener is
used to publish the `TaskExecution` on a message channel named `task-events`. This feature
is autowired into any task that has `spring-cloud-stream`, `spring-cloud-stream-<binder>`,
and a defined task on its classpath.

NOTE: To disable the event emitting listener, set the `spring.cloud.task.events.enabled`
property to `false`.

With the appropriate classpath defined, the following task emits the `TaskExecution` as an
event on the `task-events` channel (at both the start and the end of the task):

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTask
public class TaskEventsApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(TaskEventsApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Configuration
	public static class TaskConfiguration {

		@Bean
		public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner() {
			return new CommandLineRunner() {
				@Override
				public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
					System.out.println("The CommandLineRunner was executed");
				}
			};
		}
	}
}
----

NOTE: A binder implementation is also required to be on the classpath.

NOTE: A sample task event application can be found in the samples module
of the Spring Cloud Task Project,
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples/task-events[here].

[[stream-integration-disable-task-events]]
=== Disabling Specific Task Events

To disable task events, you can set the `spring.cloud.task.events.enabled` property to
`false`.

[[stream-integration-batch-events]]
== Spring Batch Events

When executing a Spring Batch job through a task, Spring Cloud Task can be configured to
emit informational messages based on the Spring Batch listeners available in Spring Batch.
Specifically, the following Spring Batch listeners are autoconfigured into each batch job
and emit messages on the associated Spring Cloud Stream channels when run through Spring
Cloud Task:

* `JobExecutionListener` listens for `job-execution-events`
* `StepExecutionListener` listens for `step-execution-events`
* `ChunkListener` listens for `chunk-events`
* `ItemReadListener` listens for `item-read-events`
* `ItemProcessListener` listens for `item-process-events`
* `ItemWriteListener` listens for `item-write-events`
* `SkipListener` listens for `skip-events`

These listeners are autoconfigured into any `AbstractJob` when the appropriate
beans (a `Job` and a `TaskLifecycleListener`) exist in the context. Configuration to
listen to these events is handled the same way binding to any other Spring
Cloud Stream channel is done.  Our task (the one running the batch job) serves as a
`Source`, with the listening applications serving as either a `Processor` or a `Sink`.

An example could be to have an application listening to the `job-execution-events` channel
for the start and stop of a job. To configure the listening application, you would
configure the input to be `job-execution-events` as follows:

`spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=job-execution-events`

NOTE: A binder implementation is also required to be on the classpath.

NOTE: A sample batch event application can be found in the samples module
of the Spring Cloud Task Project,
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples/batch-events[here].

=== Sending Batch Events to Different Channels

One of the options that Spring Cloud Task offers for batch events is the ability to alter
the channel to which a specific listener can emit its messages. To do so, use the
following configuration:
`spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<the channel>.destination=<new destination>`. For example,
if `StepExecutionListener` needs to emit its messages to another channel called
`my-step-execution-events` instead of the default `step-execution-events`, you can add the
following configuration:

`spring.cloud.stream.bindings.step-execution-events.destination=my-step-execution-events`

=== Disabling Batch Events
To disable the listener functionality for all batch events, use the following
configuration:

`spring.cloud.task.batch.events.enabled=false`

To disable a specific batch event, use the following configuration:

`spring.cloud.task.batch.events.<batch event listener>.enabled=false`:

The following listing shows individual listeners that you can disable:

[source,bash]
----
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.job-execution.enabled=false
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.step-execution.enabled=false
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.chunk.enabled=false
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.item-read.enabled=false
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.item-process.enabled=false
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.item-write.enabled=false
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.skip.enabled=false
----

=== Emit Order for Batch Events
By default, batch events have `Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE`. To change this value (for
example, to 5 ), use the following configuration:

[source,bash]
----
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.job-execution-order=5
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.step-execution-order=5
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.chunk-order=5
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.item-read-order=5
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.item-process-order=5
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.item-write-order=5
spring.cloud.task.batch.events.skip-order=5
----
