Basic Samples
=============

This is a good place to get started. The samples here are technically motivated and demonstrate the bare minimum with regard to configuration and code to help you to get introduced to the basic concepts, API and configuration of [Spring Integration](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration) and how they relate to [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.eaipatterns.com/) (EIP). 

For example; if your are looking for an answer on how to wire a **Service Activator** to a **Channel** or how to apply a **Gateway** to your message exchange or how to get started with using the **Mail** or **XML** module etc., this would be the right place to find a good sample.
