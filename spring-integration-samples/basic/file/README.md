File Sample
===========

This example demonstrates the following aspects of the File operations support available with Spring Integration:

1. File Inbound Channel Adapter
2. File Outbound Channel Adapter
3. File-to-Bytes Transformer

Furthermore, a Poller is used as well.

The use case is a simple file copy, but implemented in 3 basic flavors:

1. Binary file copy
2. Text file copy
3. Simple file copy

To run the samples simply execute the 3 test cases located in the **org.springframework.integration.samples.filecopy** package.
