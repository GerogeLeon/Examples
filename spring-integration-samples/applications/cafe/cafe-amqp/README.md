## Instructions for running the CafeDemo AMQP sample

### Distributed components
To run this alternative configuration of the sample, be sure to have a RabbitMQ broker started on localhost:5672 configured with the default guest|guest client credentials on the / vHost, then execute the following test classes in order:

   1. **cafeDemoAppBaristaColdAmqp** - starts the Cold Drink Barista
   2. **cafeDemoAppBaristaHotAmqp**  - starts the Hot Drink Barista
   3. **cafeDemoAppAmqp**            - starts the Cafe Storefront (Places 100 orders on the orders queue)
   4. **cafeDemoAppOperationsAmqp**  - starts the Cafe Operations (OrderSplitter, DrinkRouter, PreparedDrinkAggregator)

**Note**: All AMQP exchanges, queues, and bindings needed for this sample are defined within the different xml config files that support the above test classes.
