Intermediate Samples
====================

This category targets developers who are already familiar with the [Spring Integration](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration) framework (past getting started), but need some more guidance while resolving more advanced technical problems that they have to deal with once having switched to a Messaging architecture. 

For example; If you are looking for an answer on how to handle errors in various scenarios or how to properly configure the **Aggregator** for the situations where some messages might not ever arrive for aggregation etc., and any other issue that goes beyond a basic understanding and configuration of a particular component and addresses "what else you can do with it" type of problem, this would be the right place to find these type of samples.
