Advanced Samples
================

This category targets advanced developers who are well familiar with the [Spring Integration](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration) framework but are looking to extend it to address a specific custom need by extending from Spring Integration's public API. 

For example; if you are looking for samples showing you how to implement a custom **Channel** or **Consumer** (event-based or polling-based), or if you trying to figure out what is the most appropriate way to implement a custom **BeanParser** on top of the Spring Integration BeanParser hierarchy when implementing custom namespaces, this would be the right place to look.

Here you can also find samples that will help you with adapter development. Spring Integration comes with an extensive library of adapters that allow you to connect remote systems with Spring Integration messaging framework. However you might have a need to integrate with systems for which the core framework does not provide an adapter and consequently you may have to implement your own adapter. This category would include samples showing you how to implement various adapters.
